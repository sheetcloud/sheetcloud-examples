   EXAMPLE 1: BASIC READING AND WRITING
   ====================================

   Here you'll find examples of the most common use cases. 


   NO ACCOUNT? START HERE...
   =========================

   You'll need your sheetcloud username and password to get started. If you don't how, here are the steps:

    1. Head over to `https://sheetcloud.org` and connect your account with Sheetcloud. 
       Sheetcloud offers a free trial and no credit card is required to connect your account.
    2. Once you connected your account successfully, the redirect should take you to your 
       Sheetcloud settings spreadsheet in your account. On the `Settings` page, you'll find your username and
       initial password (you can change this later if you'd like).
    3. Before runnning the examples, create the following environment variables from your username and password:
        SHEETCLOUD_USERNAME
        SHEETCLOUD_PASSWORD
       Most commonly, people create `.env` files in the ROOT of the project folder containing all environment variables
       needed to run the project. Due to security reasons, we strongly advice you to NOT store your username and password 
       in your python files directly.

    How to check?
    Check the logs when you run the example. Sheetcloud will tell you whether or not it could find username and password.
